# Creative Coding Handouts and Sketches

# 2D Animation and Interaction
## A video course by Andrew Glassner

## What This Repo Is About

In August 2010 I published a book to help people learn creative coding with computer graphics.
The book is called
[Processing for Visual Artists: How to Create Expressive Images and Interactive Art.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1568817169)
The goal was to help anyone write interactive graphics programs and games,
using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) language.

Over the following three years I created a companion video course for the book.
The course contains 231 videos that offer a bit under 35 hours of clear, illustrated
instruction. I don't assume you know anything about programming, or building interactive
programs. We cover everything up to and including how to write complete, interactive art pieces and games.
The course was a lot of fun and students produced some amazing work!

I offered the course as a commercial product for many years, but I don't currently
have the time to maintain it, so I've decided to
make the entire course available entirely for free on YouTube.

## Where to Find the Course Videos

## What's in This Repo

In this repo, you'll find 8 zip files, one for each week of the course. In each zip
file you'll find two PDFs: an overview for that week,
and then a concluding summary of all that we covered.
Throughout the zip files are also about 360 sketches, or Processing programs, each identified by the
video it's used in. These sketches demonstrate the techniques being discussed,
and also show how I made the visuals used in every video.

The **Course-Syllabus** PDF offers a detailed guide to every week, every group of 
videos, and every video. It also identifies which programs, or sketches, are 
associated with each video. Note that the syllabus sometimes refers to homework;
now that the course is free, there's no homework, and I won't be reviewing files.

The programs were written for the Java version of Processing 1.2. 
Processing is now up to version 2, and there's a Javascript version as well.
This course only addresses the Java version, using code developed in Processing's
own coding environment. 
I believe that the programs all run, but there may be compatibility
or performance issues. 
If you prefer the Javascript environment,
I think that most of these programs can be ported
over to Javascript in a more or less direct way.

Note that Processing requires each sketch to reside in its own folder 
that has the same name as the sketch itself, 
as in these zip files.
If you change any folder or sketch names,
remember to change the other name to match.

I'm offering everything here for free, and as-is. I don't guarantee that the programs
are free of errors, and I don't assert that they're fit for any application. They're
offered here as educational reference resources only.

These videos were a ton of fun to create, and a lot of people have
learned from them over the years. 
I am happy with how they address the fundamentals of creative coding
and Processing itself, and still do a good job of sharing the pleasure
of making interactive art.
Since I don't have the time to actively run the course right now,
I am very happy to offer these to offer you the videos and programs for free.

I hope you enjoy them, learn from them, and create amazing and
wonderful work!
