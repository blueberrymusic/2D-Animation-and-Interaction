# Creative Coding Handouts and Sketches

# 2D Animation and Interaction
## A video course by Andrew Glassner

In August 2010 I published a book to help people learn creative coding with computer graphics.
The book is called
[Processing for Visual Artists: How to Create Expressive Images and Interactive Art.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1568817169)
The goal was to help anyone write interactive graphics programs and games,
using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) language.

Over the following three years I created a companion video course for the book.
The course contains 231 videos that offer a bit under 35 hours of clear, illustrated
instruction on everything from how to use the Processing language to how to write
complete, interactive art pieces and games.

I offered the course as a commercial product for many years, but I've now decided to
make it available entirely for free on YouTube.
You can find the course at [link here.](https://link-here)

In this repo, you'll find 8 zip files, one for each week of the course. In each zip
file you'll find that week's overview, and a summary of all that we cover.
There are also about 360 sketches, or Processing programs, each identified by the
video it's used in. These sketches demonstrate the techniques being discussed,
and also show how I made the visuals used in every video.

The programs were written for Processing 1.2. The current version is Processing 2.
I believe that the programs all run, but some may not, or there may be compaitbility
or performance issues. 

**I am not actively supporting any of these programs.** 

Please don't send me bug reports; I just don't have the time to manage, fix, and
maintain this code. It's free, after all! If you find an error, and you
have fixed it yourself, you can send me a pull request. Or you can fork the repo
and update everything, or otherwise do with the code as you will.

I'm offering everything here for free, and as-is. I don't guarantee that the programs
are free of errors, and I don't assert that they're fit for any application. They're
offered here as educational reference resources only.
