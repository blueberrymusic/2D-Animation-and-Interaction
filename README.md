# Creative Coding Handouts and Sketches

## A video course by Andrew Glassner

## What This Repo Is About

In August 2010 I published a book to help people learn creative coding with computer graphics.
The book is called
[Processing for Visual Artists: How to Create Expressive Images and Interactive Art.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1568817169)
The goal was to help anyone write interactive graphics programs and games,
using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) language.

Over the following three years I created a companion video course for the book.
The course contains 231 videos that offer a bit under 35 hours of clear, illustrated
instruction. I don't assume you know anything about programming, or building interactive
programs. We cover everything up to and including how to write complete, interactive art pieces and games.
The course was a lot of fun for both students and myself,
and I had the pleasure of seeing some amazing work!
Students have gone on to produce visualizations, art, interactive experiences,
and lots of other projects using Processing as well as other languages and systems. 

I've offered the course as a commercial product for many years, but I don't currently
have the time to actively run it, so I've decided to
make the entire course available for free.

## Where to Find the Course Videos

Watch all the course videos on the
[Imaginary Institute channel on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6pH1kUIReTVzX7TIpvAw)

## What's in This Repo

This repo contains all the files associated with the course
except for the videos themselves, which are on YouTube.

Here you'll find 8 zip files, one for each week of the course. In each zip
file you'll find two PDFs: one providing an overview for that week,
and the other a programming
reference that summarizes the Processing ideas covered in that week's videos.
Also in the zip files are about 360 sketches, 
or Processing programs, each identified by the
video it's used in. These sketches demonstrate the techniques being discussed,
and also show how I made the visuals used in every video.

The **Course-Syllabus** PDF offers a detailed guide to every week, every group of 
videos, every video, and every Processing sketch. 
Note that the syllabus sometimes refers to homework;
now that the course is free, there's no homework, and I won't be reviewing programs.

The programs were written for the Java version of Processing 1.2. 
Processing is now up to version 2, and there's a Javascript version as well.
This course only addresses the Java version, using code developed in Processing's
own coding environment. 
I believe that the programs all run, but there may be compatibility
or performance issues. 
If you prefer the Javascript environment,
I think that most of these programs can be ported to the
Javascript version of Processing.

Note that Processing requires each sketch to reside in its own folder 
that has the same name as the sketch itself, 
as in these zip files.
If you change any folder or sketch names,
remember to change the other name to match.

These videos were a ton of fun to create, 
and it's been very rewarding to work with many talented
and creative students over the years.
I am happy with how these videos address the fundamentals of creative coding
and Processing itself, and I hope they will help lots of new people
discover the pleasure of making interactive art.
Since I don't have the time to actively run the course right now,
I am very happy to offer these to offer you the videos and programs for free.

I hope you enjoy them, learn from them, and create amazing and
wonderful work!
